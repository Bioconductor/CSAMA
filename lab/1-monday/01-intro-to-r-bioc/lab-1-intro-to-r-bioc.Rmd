This lab has five parts. Each part consists of informative material
followed by short or intermediate length exercises and case
studies. The material introduces or refreshes your knowledge of _R_,
and walks through some of the central classes and annotation resources
for working with high-throughput sequence data in _Bioconductor_.

It's recommended that you choose two or three of the following
sections, and spend about 45 minutes to an hour on each. Take time to
work through the code in the material as well as the exercises, asking
questions of your colleagues and the TAs as needed. If you are
relatively new to _R_, then consider doing sections 1 and 3. If you are
new to _Bioconductor_, then skim the second and focus on the third and
fourth sections.

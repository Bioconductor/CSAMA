  abstract    = "Microbial growth curves are used to study differential effects
                 of media, genetics, and stress on microbial population growth.
                 Consequently, many modeling frameworks exist to capture
                 microbial population growth measurements. However, current
                 models are designed to quantify growth under conditions for
                 which growth has a specific functional form. Extensions to
                 these models are required to quantify the effects of
                 perturbations, which often exhibit nonstandard growth curves.
                 Rather than assume specific functional forms for experimental
                 perturbations, we developed a general and robust model of
                 microbial population growth curves using Gaussian process (GP)
                 regression. GP regression modeling of high-resolution
                 time-series growth data enables accurate quantification of
                 population growth and allows explicit control of effects from
                 other covariates such as genetic background. This framework
                 substantially outperforms commonly used microbial population
                 growth models, particularly when modeling growth data from
                 environmentally stressed populations. We apply the GP growth
                 model and develop statistical tests to quantify the
                 differential effects of environmental perturbations on
                 microbial growth across a large compendium of genotypes in
                 archaea and yeast. This method accurately identifies known
                 transcriptional regulators and implicates novel regulators of
                 growth under standard and stress conditions in the model
                 archaeal organism Halobacterium salinarum For yeast, our
                 method correctly identifies known phenotypes for a diversity
                 of genetic backgrounds under cyclohexamide stress and also
                 detects previously unidentified oxidative stress sensitivity
                 across a subset of strains. Together, these results
                 demonstrate that the GP models are interpretable,
                 recapitulating biological knowledge of growth response while
                 providing new insights into the relevant parameters affecting
                 microbial population growth.",

  abstract    = "RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide
                 differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear
                 how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid
                 biological interpretation of the results or which statistical
                 tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment
                 with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was
                 performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for
                 experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of
                 the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%-40\% of the
                 significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified
                 with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to >85\%
                 for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more
                 than fourfold. To achieve >85\% for all SDE genes regardless
                 of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates.
                 The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery
                 rate at ≲5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the
                 remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately,
                 particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq
                 experiments, these results suggest that at least six
                 biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12
                 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold
                 changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior
                 combination of true positive and false positive performances
                 makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate
                 numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and
                 DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.",

Understanding these systems needs integrated bioinformatic analysis. Public databases such as Ensembl provide relationships and mappings between the relevant sets of probe and target molecules. However, the relationships can be biologically complex and the content of the databases is dynamic. We demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and jointly analyze experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are encountered in making gene-to-transcript-to-protein mappings. The approach provides a flexible, programmable and reproducible basis for state-of-the-art bioinformatic data integration.}},

@article{Leong2014Global,

Their global biological significance is unproven and remains controversial. Here we investigate the role played by ncRNAs in the stress response of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We integrate global proteomics and RNA sequencing data to identify a systematic programme in which elevated antisense RNA arising both from ncRNAs and from 3'-overlapping convergent gene pairs is directly associated with substantial reductions in protein levels throughout the genome. We describe an extensive array of ncRNAs with trans associations that have the potential to influence multiple pathways. Deletion of one such locus reduces levels of atf1, a transcription factor downstream of the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and alters sensitivity to oxidative stress. These non-coding transcripts therefore regulate specific stress responses, adding unanticipated information-processing capacity to the MAPK signalling system.}},

@article{Leek2014Svaseq,

These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and FPKM-based data. These updates are available through the sva Bioconductor package and I have made fully reproducible analysis using these methods available from: https://github.com/jtleek/svaseq. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2014.

Reports are not generic, but have been individually designed to reflect content specific to the result type detected. Tabular output included in reports is sortable, filterable and searchable and contains context-relevant hyperlinks to external databases. Additionally, in-line graphics have been developed for specific analysis types and are embedded by default within table rows, providing a useful visual summary of underlying raw data. ReportingTools is highly flexible and reports can be easily customized for specific applications using the well-defined API.}},

    abstract = {{Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide. Glucocorticoids are a mainstay therapy for asthma because they exert anti-inflammatory effects in multiple lung tissues, including the airway smooth muscle (ASM). However, the mechanism by which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation in ASM remains poorly understood. Using RNA-Seq, a high-throughput sequencing method, we characterized transcriptomic changes in four primary human ASM cell lines that were treated with dexamethasone--a potent synthetic glucocorticoid (1 µM for 18 hours). Based on a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value <0.05, we identified 316 differentially expressed genes, including both well known (DUSP1, KLF15, PER1, TSC22D3) and less investigated (C7, CCDC69, CRISPLD2) glucocorticoid-responsive genes. CRISPLD2, which encodes a secreted protein previously implicated in lung development and endotoxin regulation, was found to have SNPs that were moderately associated with inhaled corticosteroid resistance and bronchodilator response among asthma patients in two previously conducted genome-wide association studies. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that dexamethasone treatment significantly increased CRISPLD2 mRNA and protein expression in ASM cells. CRISPLD2 expression was also induced by the inflammatory cytokine IL1β, and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CRISPLD2 further increased IL1β-induced expression of IL6 and IL8. Our findings offer a comprehensive view of the effect of a glucocorticoid on the ASM transcriptome and identify CRISPLD2 as an asthma pharmacogenetics candidate gene that regulates anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids in the ASM.}},

    abstract = {{DNA microarrays are a new and promising biotechnology whichallows the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously. The present paper describes statistical methods for the identi cation of di erentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments. Although it is not the main focus of the paper, new methods for the important pre-processing steps of image analysis and normalization are proposed. Given suitably normalized data, the biological question of di erential expression is restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test for each geneof the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and responses or covariates of interest. Di erentially expressed genes are identi ed based on adjusted p-values for a multiple testing procedure which strongly controls the family-wise Type I error rate and takes into account the dependence structure between the gene expression levels. No speci c parametric form is assumed for the distribution of the test statistics and a permutation procedure is used to estimate adjusted p-values. Several data displays are suggested for the visual identi cation of di erentially expressed genes and of important features of these genes. The above methods are applied to microarray data from a study of gene expression in the livers of mice with very low HDL cholesterol levels. The genes identi ed using data from multiple slides are compared to those identi ed by recently published single-slide methods. Key words and phrases: Adjusted p-value, di erential gene expression, DNA microarray, image analysis, multiple testing, normalization, permutation test. 1.}},

              date conversions affect at least 30 gene names; the

    abstract = {{In recent years, advances in high throughput sequencing technology have led to a need for specialized methods for the analysis of digital gene expression data. While gene expression data measured on a microarray take on continuous values and can be modeled using the normal distribution, RNA sequencing data involve nonnegative counts and are more appropriately modeled using a discrete count distribution, such as the Poisson or the negative binomial. Consequently, analytic tools that assume a Gaussian distribution (such as classification methods based on linear discriminant analysis and clustering methods that use Euclidean distance) may not perform as well for sequencing data as methods that are based upon a more appropriate distribution. Here, we propose new approaches for performing classification and clustering of observations on the basis of sequencing data. Using a Poisson log linear model, we develop an analog of diagonal linear discriminant analysis that is appropriate for sequencing data. We also propose an approach for clustering sequencing data using a new dissimilarity measure that is based upon the Poisson model. We demonstrate the performances of these approaches in a simulation study, on three publicly available RNA sequencing data sets, and on a publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set.}},

RNA-seq experiments allow for the identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes and their corresponding isoforms on a genome-wide scale. However, statistical methods are required to ensure that accurate identifications are made. A number of methods exist for identifying DE genes, but far fewer are available for identifying DE isoforms. When isoform DE is of interest, investigators often apply gene-level (count-based) methods directly to estimates of isoform counts. Doing so is not recommended. In short, estimating isoform expression is relatively straightforward for some groups of isoforms, but more challenging for others. This results in estimation uncertainty that varies across isoform groups. Count-based methods were not designed to accommodate this varying uncertainty, and consequently, application of them for isoform inference results in reduced power for some classes of isoforms and increased false discoveries for others.}},

Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature.

It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications.Availability and implementation: featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.

@article{Bourgon2010Independent,
    abstract = {{With high-dimensional data, variable-by-variable statistical testing is often used to select variables whose behavior differs across conditions. Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50\%. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering—using filter/test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative—is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.}},

RNA-seq can be used for a variety of applications, however, identifying differential expression (DE) remains a key task in functional genomics. There have been a number of statistical methods for DE detection for RNA-seq data. One common feature of several leading methods is the use of the negative binomial (Gamma–Poisson mixture) model. That is, the unobserved gene expression is modeled by a gamma random variable and, given the expression, the sequencing read counts are modeled as Poisson. The distinct feature in various methods is how the variance, or dispersion, in the Gamma distribution is modeled and estimated. We evaluate several large public RNA-seq datasets and find that the estimated dispersion in existing methods does not adequately capture the heterogeneity of biological variance among samples. We present a new empirical Bayes shrinkage estimate of the dispersion parameters and demonstrate improved DE detection.}},

This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described.

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

One key way of analysing such data is to look for elements of the data which display particular patterns of differential expression in order to take these forward for further analysis and validation.RESULTS:We propose a framework for defining patterns of differential expression and develop a novel algorithm, baySeq, which uses an empirical Bayes approach to detect these patterns of differential expression within a set of sequencing samples. The method assumes a negative binomial distribution for the data and derives an empirically determined prior distribution from the entire dataset. We examine the performance of the method on real and simulated data.CONCLUSIONS:Our method performs at least as well, and often better, than existing methods for analyses of pairwise differential expression in both real and simulated data. When we compare methods for the analysis of data from experimental designs involving multiple sample groups, our method again shows substantial gains in performance. We believe that this approach thus represents an important step forward for the analysis of count data from sequencing experiments.}},

abstract = {Summary:Bioinformatics research frequently involves handling gene-centric data such as exons, transcripts, proteins, and their positions relative to a reference coordinate system. The ensembldb Bioconductor package retrieves and stores Ensembl-based genetic annotations and positional information, and furthermore offers identifier conversion and coordinate mappings for gene-associated data. In support of reproducible research, data are tied to Ensembl releases and are kept separately from the software. Premade data packages are available for a variety of genomes and Ensembl releases. Three examples demonstrate typical use cases of this software.

Availability:ensembldb is part of Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/ensembldb).

More intermingling faculty - students
More interactivity in the labs - perhaps have Q&A sessions right after the mid-afternoon coffee break
CODEX-Akoya / spatial data
Something on DL?
More systematic introduction into the creation of modern research outputs (Rmarkdown vignettes, optinally with interactive widgets in them (plotly); Shiny)

What to drop?

Perhaps the "Annotation resources" lecture can be made more concrete by adding a concrete dataset integration / "metaanalysis" running example?
Group projects did not work well this time. My impression: objectives unclear / too broad, students already inundated with everything else.

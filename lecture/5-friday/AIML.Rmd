## AI/Ml

*If your time to you is worth savin'\
And you better start swimmin'\
Or you'll sink like a stone\
For the times they are a-changin'*\
Bob Dylan\

- the set of things where we have good AI/ML solutions is changing rapidly
- notable recent advances:  alphaFold, collabFold, multimeric versions
- large language models:  chatGPT, 

## AI five years ago

- machine learning was mostly split into two types of problems:
     - classification or supervised machine learning
     - clustering or unsupervised machine learning
- and we could say things like: you need to decide on a distance between cases in order to do machine learning, since that is how you decide if two things are similar or not
- and we tended to think of cases and features
- euclidean distance and so on
- but models like alphaFold and LLMs are way more complex and it will take some time to undertstand their actual mechanisms



## alphaFold/collabFold
![](Casp.png){width=45%}

- CASP is (was?) a contest to predict protein structure from sequence

- alphaFold was first, collabFold is faster and cheaper to run

## alphaFold Multimer

- instead of predicting the structure of a single protein can we predict the co-structure of two or more proteins

- Predicted Template Modeling Score (pTM) measures the structural congruency between two folded protein structures

## LLMs

-  the model learns to predict the subsequent word in a sentence based on the preceding words. 
- a large corpus of documents (quite broad definition of documents) is embedded into a very high dimensional space
- a many billion parameter model is trained (real cost is millions USD)
- the model can subsequently be fine-tuned to specific tasks

## Cautionary Tales

- we have all seen the amazing things that LLMs like chatGPT can do
- and some of the things it gets amazingly wrong
- it is basically a gigantic autocomplete mechansim, where from a single prompt one can write a book
- it can be good at things it was trained on and variations of these models will likely revolutionize many fields (eg. patent filing, lab protocol writing, etc.)
- **BUT** it seems to be best used by someone already expert in a field who can filter out the nonsense
- users that are naive to a discipline likely lack the skills to fact check some of the GPT pronouncements

## Cautionary Tales

- lots of methods of using these models to write code 
- but that code may not work as needed, may be inefficient
- so here too we recommend that they are useful for experts and might be less useful for naive programmers
- eg I have heard from many who produce complex plots that chatGPT search is very good at suggesting what parameters to tweak to obtain a desired change

## For Teachers

One strategy could be

- encourage use of chatGPT and other LLMs **but**

- ask for prompts

- ask for LLM output

- ask for student's synthesis

## scGPT

- scGPT is a foundation model designed for single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, and protein abundance. 

- model trained on single-cell data from 10 million human cells.

- Each cell contains expression values for a fraction of the approximately 20,000 human genes. 
 
- The model learns embeddings of this large cell × gene matrix, which provide insights into the underlying cellular states and active biological pathways. 
 
## scGPT - learning tasks

- they define multiple fine tuning tasks (to get to the auto-complete world)
 
 Such as: 
 
- Gene Expression Prediction: Within each cell, mask expression values for a subset of genes; scGPT is optimized to accurately predict the masked expression values 

- Cell Type Classification

- etc

## Other LLMs in molecular biology

- sets of models based on protein function prediction
- the language is protein sequence
- proteins can be engineered with certain properties based on existing corpus of known sequence to function data
 
## Classification

- I want to spend a little time on classification
- this is the problem of finding a set of rules to help predict the class of a new observation, for which you only have the features
- we need a training data set in order to develop the model
- we use tools like cross-validation; dividing our data in test, train, validate; and similar sorts of approaches.
- I am going to introduce the subject via a method called Random Forests, due to Leo Brieman
- *The Elements of Statistical Learning* by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman is a great resource for many of these tools and I base my notes here on their description

## Random Forests

![](RFalg.png){width=95%}
- if the data set is large (lots of cases) you might want to do subsampling of individuals and variables

- R implementation differs in some important ways - read the manual

## Out of Bag (OOB)

*For each observation $z_i = (x_i,y_i)$, construct its random forest predictor by averaging only those trees corresponding to (bootstrap) samples in which $z_i$ did not appear.*

- this would apply to any other aggregate method that relies on bootstrap sampling or subsampling
- it gives an *independent* estimate of the prediction error, since the data point was not used in building any of the trees used for prediction

- When the number of variables is large, but the fraction of relevant variables small, random forests are likely to perform poorly with small m (number of features selected for each tree).
- At each split the chance can be small that the relevant variables will be selected.

## Variable Importance

- At each split in each tree, the improvement in the split-criterion is the importance measure attributed to the splitting variable
- this is accumulated over all the trees in the forest separately for each variable.
- variable importance is not affected much (if at all) by collinearity
- **R Implementation** The “local” (or casewise) variable importance is computed as follows: For classification, it is the
increase in percent of times a case is OOB and misclassified when the variable is permuted. For
regression, it is the average increase in squared OOB residuals when the variable is permuted.

## Isolation Forests

- Basic Problem: Do I have any outliers - anomalies?
- The main idea behind Isolation forests is that outliers are typically unusual data points.  
- Thus, they often are far (in some metric) from the majority of data points.
- similarly to random forests, isolation forests are built out of isolation trees, and then some averaging is done.

## Isolation Forests

## The ideas behind the algorithm

Based on:
https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf?q=isolation-forest

- proposed method takes advantage of two quantitative properties of anomalies: 
    i) they are the minority consisting of fewer instances and 
    ii) they have attribute-values that are very different from those of normal instances. 
    
- In other words, anomalies are ‘few and different’, which make them more susceptible to isolation than normal points.

-there are only two variables in this method: the number of trees to build and the sub-sampling size.

- the advantage of subsampling is that it makes the data sets small

## The isolation tree algorithm

- they seem to suggest just subsampling, they are working on very big data sets

- **first** create a partition by first randomly selecting a feature and then selecting a value between the minimum and maximum value of the selected feature as the split. 

- This creates a partition, the data points on one side of the split and those on the other. 

- The algorithm recursively takes one of the resulting sides and splits it, in the same fashion 

- repeats until all data points are singletons in the tree.

- Outliers should manifest themselves by a smaller number of splits needed to get them to be singletons.

## Isolation Forest

- You create a predetermined number of such trees

- Now, you take each observation in your data set and "run it through each tree" to get the depth in that tree

- compute some measure of average depth 

- outliers manifest themselves by smaller depth

- but another way of thinking about these average depths is that they constitute some sort of distance from the observation and all the other data points in the set

The isotree package in R, actually does some fancier things, among them, the fitting process returns a model that can be used for prediction. It also has methods to deal with categorical variables.

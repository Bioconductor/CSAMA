Pleasure to welcome you all

This week a mix of theory/conceptual lectures, practical labs on your own computers, informal networking & discussions.

We of course hope that there's something in it for all of you. We fully realize that you all have different backgrounds, and that's fine.

If some topic seems like repetition, please do not worry - I promise that the lecturers and labs try to put in some unique angle and advanced insights as well.

If some topic is very new to you, try to follow as much as you can, the material will remain online, and if it is needed for your work, you will revisit it anyway.

The schedule is online, I do not need to loose many words on it, we basically try to follow your biorhythm, with the more theoretical stuff in the morning, practical work in the afternoon, and informal discussions in the evening.

Thank you to all the people who helped organise, the lecturers and TAs. Looking forward to a great week.

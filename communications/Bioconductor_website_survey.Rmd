We’re redesigning the Bioconductor website and we need YOUR input!

We’ve created a survey to understand the needs of our diverse user base. Whether you’re a wet lab biologist, student, data analyst, developer, system administrator, educator, or any other role, we’d love to hear from you!

This is your chance to shape the future of http://Bioconductor.org! Your experiences, challenges, and ideas will help us to enhance the website’s design and structure.


The survey takes about 5-10 minutes and closes on Friday, June 23rd.

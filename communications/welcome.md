Pleasure to welcome you.

This week will be a mix of theoretical /  conceptual lectures, practical labs on your own computer, and informal networking and discussions.
The lectures take place every day, Monday to Friday, from 8.30 - 12.00, with a break at 10:00 for 1/2h with coffee and snacks.
From 12-14h, we have a lunch break. We encourage you to form small groups and explore Brixen downtown with its many eateries.
Faculty will typically hang out here in the garden, and you are welcome to talk to us, say, between 13 and 14h.
The labs run from 14:00-16:30, with a coffee break around 15:00
At 16:30-17:00, we have flash talks by some of the participants, this is intended to teach us what kind of research participants are interested in, 
and also of course encourage networking among participants themselves.
Between 5 and 8, you are free to have a break, perhaps do some sports, visit the fantastic swimming pool next door (Aquarena), and have dinner.
On Mon and Tue, we also have evening sessions from 8 to 10 that involve demos, showcases, and group discussions in a more informal setting.

There is a social event on Wednesday, which involves taking the cable car up the mountain, a hike in the mountains and a dinner in a mountain hut -- more details on this later.

We fully realize that you all have different backgrounds, and that is fine. So please do not worry if you have already heard of some of the topics -- 
we always also hope to have some additional and new angles and ideas.
Also, do not worry if some topics are very new to you, try to follow as much as you can, the material will remain online

Thank you to all the people who helped organise this, and the lecturers and TAs.
